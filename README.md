# AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot on AWS

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent, multi-channel **customer support chatbot** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Using **AI and serverless technologies**, the bot can engage in natural conversation, respond to queries in real-time, and escalate to human agents when needed.

The chatbot leverages **Amazon Lex** for natural language understanding (NLU) and speech recognition (ASR), integrates with **AWS Lambda** for backend logic, supports voice interaction through **Amazon Connect**, and stores session data using **DynamoDB** and **S3**. It uses **Amazon SageMaker** for continuous improvement through machine learning, and **Amazon Cognito** for secure user authentication.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deliver immediate, personalized customer support via chatbot
- Automate backend responses and data handling with serverless tools
- Support multi-channel interaction including web, mobile, and voice
- Continuously improve the chatbot using machine learning
- Practice cloud architecture using Infrastructure as Code principles
