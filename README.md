## 🚀 Project Overview

This project develops an intelligent, **multi-channel customer support chatbot** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Leveraging **AI** and **serverless technologies**, the chatbot can engage in natural conversations, provide real-time responses, and escalate issues to human agents when necessary.

Key components include:

- **Amazon Lex** for natural language understanding (NLU) and speech recognition (ASR)
- **AWS Lambda** to handle backend logic
- **Amazon Connect** for voice interaction capabilities
- **DynamoDB** and **S3** for session data storage
- **Amazon SageMaker** to continuously improve the chatbot through machine learning
- **Amazon Cognito** for secure user authentication

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deliver immediate, personalised customer support via chatbot
- Automate backend responses and data handling with serverless tools
- Support multi-channel interaction including web, mobile, and voice
- Continuously improve the chatbot using machine learning
- Practice cloud architecture using Infrastructure as Code principles
