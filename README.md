# Automated Cloud Remediation Script
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the remediation of misconfigured cloud resources in **AWS**.  
The goal is to reduce security risks and improve compliance by detecting and fixing issues such as **publicly accessible S3 buckets** and **overly permissive security groups**.  

The solution leverages **Python** and **AWS Lambda** to provide a scalable, event-driven approach for proactive cloud security management.  

---

## Skills Developed
- Writing Python scripts for cloud automation  
- Implementing serverless functions with AWS Lambda  
- Detecting and remediating misconfigured AWS resources  
- Automating security compliance checks  
- Integrating logging and alerting for automated remediation workflows  

---

## Tools & Services Used
- **Python** – Script development and logic implementation  
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless execution of remediation functions  
- **AWS IAM** – Roles and permissions for Lambda execution  
- **AWS S3** – Detect and remediate publicly accessible buckets  
- **AWS Security Groups** – Identify and fix overly permissive rules  
- **CloudWatch** – Logging and monitoring remediation actions  

---

## Lab Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure AWS Lambda execution role with least privilege  
   - Set up Python runtime environment and dependencies  

2. **Detection**
   - Scan S3 buckets for public access  
   - Identify security groups with overly permissive rules  

3. **Remediation**
   - Automatically update S3 bucket policies to remove public access  
   - Modify security group rules to enforce secure inbound/outbound traffic  

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Log remediation actions to CloudWatch for auditing and verification  
   - Optional: trigger alerts for critical misconfigurations  

---

## Challenges
- Ensuring automated remediation does not disrupt legitimate operations  
- Handling multiple AWS accounts and regions consistently  
- Implementing efficient scanning and remediation without excessive Lambda execution time  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with **serverless automation** in AWS  
- Learned to detect and remediate common cloud misconfigurations  
- Improved scripting and cloud security automation skills  
- Developed understanding of compliance-driven security practices  

---

## Future Work
- Extend the script to cover additional AWS services (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda)  
- Integrate with SIEM tools for automated alerting  
- Add support for multi-region and multi-account AWS environments  
- Implement scheduled and event-triggered remediation workflows
