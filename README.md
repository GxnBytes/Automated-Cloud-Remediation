# Data Pipeline & Analytics on AWS  
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Progress-yellow)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates building a **serverless data pipeline** on **AWS** for ingestion, processing, and analytics.  
It ingests data into S3, processes it with **Lambda or AWS Glue**, queries it with **Athena or Redshift**, and visualizes insights in **QuickSight**.  

By deploying infrastructure with **Terraform or CloudFormation**, this project highlights **data engineering, serverless architecture, and analytics skills**.

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Ingest data into **S3** using **Kinesis Firehose** or **API Gateway + Lambda**  
- Process data with **AWS Glue** or **Lambda**  
- Query processed data with **Athena** or **load into Redshift**  
- Visualize analytics using **QuickSight** (or Superset for open-source)  
- Deploy infrastructure with **Terraform / CloudFormation**  

---

## ☁️ AWS Services Used  
- **S3** – Raw and processed data storage  
- **Kinesis Firehose / API Gateway + Lambda** – Data ingestion  
- **AWS Lambda / Glue** – Data processing  
- **Athena / Redshift** – Data querying and analytics  
- **QuickSight / Superset** – Visualization and dashboards  
- **Terraform / CloudFormation** – Infrastructure as Code  

---

## 📌 Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Ingestion** – Stream or batch data into S3 using Kinesis Firehose or Lambda/API Gateway  
2. **Processing** – Clean, transform, and enrich data with AWS Glue or Lambda  
3. **Analytics** – Query processed data with Athena or load into Redshift  
4. **Visualization** – Create dashboards and reports with QuickSight or Superset  
5. **Infrastructure Deployment** – Automate environment setup with Terraform or CloudFormation
